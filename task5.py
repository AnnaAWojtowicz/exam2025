"""
Write a Python function named count_starting_with(words, letter) that takes:

words — a list of strings
letter — a single-character string
The function should return the number of words in the list whose first character matches letter. The comparison is case-sensitive.

For example:

count_starting_with(["dog", "door", "cat"], "d")
should return 2.

Another example:

count_starting_with(["Apple", "ant", "anchor"], "a")
should return 2 (only ant and anchor start with lowercase a).

The function must not print anything. It should return an integer.

Note(s):

It is very important to match the example outputs precisely. The function must return the correct integer value.
The example inputs, as shown above, will be provided by the system. You should only write the function you are asked to write.
Assume all input lists contain valid non-empty strings.
You have to click the check button for any attempt at an answer to be valid.
